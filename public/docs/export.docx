Write about something that you love to do. (200 words or fewer)
The sound of my doorbell starts off high, then the pitch mellows out, and the whole effect mimics

an instrumental interpretation of rain finally finding a steady pace at which to fall. I have spent
several minutes analyzing its tone because I have had many opportunities to do so, as one

thing I love to do is order pizza and have it delivered to my house. When the delivery person
rings my doorbell, I instantly morph into one of Pavlov's dogs, salivating to the sound that
signals the arrival of the cheesy, circular glory. It smells like celebration, as I love to rejoice a
happy occasion by calling Papa John's for my favorite food. It tastes like comfort, since having
pizza delivered to my quiet home is a way for me to unwind. it looks like self-sufficiency,
because when I was younger. ordering pizza made me feel grown-up, and it still provides that
satisfaction for my child at heart. Accepting those warm cardboard boxes at my front door is
second nature to me. but I will always love ordering pizza because of the way eight slices of
something so ordinary are able to evoke feelings of independence, consolation, and joy.
